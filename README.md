This is a project I made for my master in Applied Informatics at university of Macedonia.

At the log in page you can either log in without using the remember me checkbox but everytime you open the app you'll need to register again.
By clicking it the app will remember you and you won't have to register anymore unless you click the log out button.
Even though the page is dedicated to Damian Lillard (US NBA player , playing for Portland Trail Blazers ) I'm not asking to give that name in the log in page.
You can simply use your name.
You can download the app from the opening page.
In case you missed it,there's a log out button which will return you to the log in page.

In the statistics page the reset button resets all the input in the above form and the clear button clears all the added content in the regular season table and returns to its previous form.
